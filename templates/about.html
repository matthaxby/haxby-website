<p class="about-p">Ever since I can remember I loved making things. It never mattered the medium: pencils, paint, wood, metal, CAD, circuitry etc...I just like to make stuff.  I'm obsessed with puzzles, math and science, coding and design.  </p>
<p class="about-p">I recently moved to Portland, Oregon.  This site is under construction, please visit again later! </p>
